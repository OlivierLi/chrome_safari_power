Runnning the Chrome vs Chrome benchmakrs require the use of signed builds. To do that you need to follow the following instructions:

1. Create a signing certificate in Xcode.
2. Find your code signing identity using `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`
3. Follow the chrome signing [instructions](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:chrome/installer/mac/signing/README.md)
4. Now you have a signed build!
